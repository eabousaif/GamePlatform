# GameFace!

GameFace is a tracking app that shows the video games that a player has previously played and tallies up the play-time in hours to show the player's top 3 video games. A player can visit GameFace's database of video games. There a player can view a surface-level description of a game, it's rating, year of release, and genre. This would allow a player to track what kind of games they prefer based on the time the spend on it and find new games that would best suit their preferences.

## How it Works?

The website starts with a basic Sign up/login system. A player has to provide their name, email, and gamer tag. Both gamer tag and email have to be unique in order to create a new account. Once a player account has been made, the player is redirected to their home page where they have multiple options:

1. Visit their profile

..._Shows player's name, bio, and top 3 video games_
2. Create a new video game

..._Adds a video game to the general GameFace database_
3. Add a video game to the player's personal play list and track their play time
4. View all games
5. View the player's games

A player is also able to add more play time to a game they played before and it adds it to previous play times.
